4. **Work Locations**: How many employees work at headquarters vs. remote locations?
5. **Tenure**: What's the average length of employment for terminated employees?
6. **Gender in Departments**: How does gender distribution vary across departments and job titles?
7. **Job Titles**: What's the distribution of job titles?

## Limitations
Consider these limitations:

- Some records had negative ages and were excluded (967 records). We considered employees aged 18 and above.
- Records with termination dates far in the future were excluded (1,599 records). We only considered dates less than or equal to the current date.
